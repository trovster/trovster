# üëã Hello‚Ä¶

My name is Trevor Morris aka [@trovster](https://twitter.com/trovster).

I enjoy the ‚Äúthree ems‚Äù‚Ä¶ [music üé∂](https://www.last.fm/user/trovster), [movies üçø](https://letterboxd.com/trovster/) and [mountain biking üöµ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è](https://www.strava.com/athletes/trovster).

I am a freelance **full-stack web developer** from the UK. That means I love writing HTML, CSS & JavaScript as well as PHP and MySQL.

---

I have over fifteen years of web development experience working for both small design agencies and large development companies. I am currently freelancing at [Surface](https://madebysurface.co.uk) where I work as a contractor to agencies helping them offer web development to their clients.

I have a passion for **everything web**. I am fluent in both *front*- and *back*-end coding, as well as deployment and tooling.

I develop usable and accessible front-end interfaces using web standards, including semantic HTML, CSS for layout and visual design, and JavaScript for progressive user interface enhancements.

On the server side, I use PHP and MySQL, as well as theory in database design and security. I have used multiple frameworks including FuelPHP and CodeIgniter. All large projects are now built using  [Laravel](https://laravel.com), which I have been using for almost 10 years, since version 4.

I have built WordPress projects using modern architecture, including the [Roots](https://roots.io) development tools, that allows for composer-managed dependencies build processes and continuous atomic deployments.

I have delved into the world of modern JavaScript, including NodeJS, ES2016, WebPack and [VueJS](https://vuejs.org). I have investigated JavaScript-based static site generators, deploying a custom [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) blog on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). I have built component libraries using [Fractal](https://fractal.build) and making use of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), deploying them using GitHub Actions.

I have also delved into the world of development operations (DevOps) including [Docker](https://www.docker.com), Amazon Web Services, Google App Engine Application Platform, Terraform. I have also used GitHub Actions and BitBucket Pipelines for continuous integration pipelines.
