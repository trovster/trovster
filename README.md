# 👋 Hello…

My name is Trevor Morris aka [@trovster](https://twitter.com/trovster).

I enjoy the “three ems”… [music 🎶](https://www.last.fm/user/trovster), [movies 🍿](https://letterboxd.com/trovster/) and [mountain biking 🚵‍♂️](https://www.strava.com/athletes/trovster).

I am a freelance developer from the UK. I am a *full-stack* web developer, which means I love writing HTML, CSS & JavaScript as well as PHP and MySQL.

Some of my favourite open-source projects I use on a daily basic include;

* [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
* [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)
